# linuxbot

A certified bad idea.

This is a Discord bot that lets you interact with a Linux machine. Written in C, for extra curses.

There is bound to be bugs and undefined behavior. Nothing is anywhere near complete.

## Building

This program uses [Concord](https://github.com/Cogmasters/concord).

To build, run make and put your bot token into config.json!
```sh
$ make
$ ./linuxbot
```
